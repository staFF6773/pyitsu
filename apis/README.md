# APIs

This folder contains API client implementations in different programming languages that mirror the functionality of our Python API client.

## Contents

- `js/`: JavaScript implementation of the Kitsu API client
  - Provides methods for searching anime, getting top anime, and fetching anime details
  - Matches the interface of the Python client for consistency

The API clients in this folder allow developers to interact with the Kitsu API using their preferred language while maintaining consistent behavior with the main Python implementation.
